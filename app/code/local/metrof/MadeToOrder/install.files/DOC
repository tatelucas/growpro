1. How MTO Works
================================================================================

MTO works basically in 2 ways: one is dimensional mode, where attributes are 
used to represent the physical size of a product, the other mode is standard 
mode.  In dimensional MTO reads certain attributes from your products and 
creates form input fields on the product info page to accept input in a certain 
format.  In standard mode, only a textbox is shown to the end user, and the 
product's attribute is only used as a title for the field.

2. Creating Dimensional Attributes
================================================================================

For MTO to work with dimensional features, it expects a range of possible 
values.  So, you must make 3 attributes for every dimension that you want to 
record:

- Dimension Minimum
- Dimension Maximum
- Dimension Stepping

The minimum and maximum are used as starting and ending points for creating 
form inputs.  The stepping is used to determin the amount of values that can 
be chosen by the user that lie in between two whole amounts.  So, for inches
a stepping value of "1/4" would allow the user to choose 1/4 in., 1/2 in., and 
3/4 in. increments of every whole inch.  

For metric, the stepping is the smallest centimeter amount that can be chosen 
by the user.  The metric mode treats "whole values" as 10 times the step value. 
So, for a stepping of 1, the first form field would allow values like :

- 10
- 20
- 30
- 40
- ... (up to mto_xxx_max)

With a second input allowing 1 centimeter increments of 1-9.  For a stepping 
of 10, the first input would contain

- 100
- 200
- 300
- 400
- ... (up to mto_xxx_max)

With a second input allowing 10 centimeter increments from 10 to 90.
